## About

![][jgneff]
I'm a self-employed programmer, typographer, and system administrator.
I write software for the Java platform, design books with the LaTeX typesetting system, and manage servers running the Ubuntu operating system.

**Trivia:**
I have run my own Web and e-mail servers on the Internet since 1996.
I switched my server to Linux in 2000 and my desktop to Linux in 2006.
The path I took in learning programming languages was: *BASIC → Fortran → Pascal → COBOL → Series/1 EDL → Series/1 Assembly → Rexx → C → System/370 Assembly → C++ → Java.*
The path I took in learning human languages was: *English → French → Italian → French.* (I still struggle with French.)

**Claim to Fame:**
I got Ubuntu Warty Warthog onto [primetime TV][clip] way back in 2005 when a friend asked me to write some "geek speek" for [his episode][episode] of *Veronica Mars*.

## Experience

My first programming job after university was a summer internship at Uludağ University in Bursa, Turkey.
After the summer, I joined IBM as a systems programmer working first in Palo Alto, California, then in Rome, Italy, and then back in Mountain View, California.
After leaving IBM, I started my own business as a proprietary software developer and member of a Limited Liability Company in California and Washington.
Now I live in Vancouver, British Columbia, and hope to work full-time on open-source projects.
