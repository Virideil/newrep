# About Me

![Picture of John Neffenger](images/profile-1x.jpg){:.right width="156" height="156" srcset="images/profile-2x.jpg 2x"}
I'm a self-employed programmer, typographer, and system administrator.
I write software for the Java platform, design books with the LaTeX typesetting system, and manage systems running the Ubuntu operating system.
*Status Six Communications* is my sole proprietorship and fictitious business name.

**Linux**&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'm a longtime fan of Linux.
I ran my own Web and e-mail server on the Internet from May 1996 through July 2020.
I switched my server to Linux in 2000 and my desktop to Linux in 2006.
I even got Ubuntu onto primetime TV way back in 2005 when a friend asked me to write [30 seconds of "geek speek"][clip] for his episode of *Veronica Mars*.

**Languages**&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'm also a fan of Java once again.
The path I took in learning programming languages was: *BASIC → Fortran → Pascal → COBOL → Series/1 EDL → Series/1 Assembly → Rexx → C → System/370 Assembly → C++ → Java.*
The path I took in learning human languages was: *English → French → Italian → French* (although I still struggle with French).

## Experience

My first programming job after university was a summer internship at Uludağ University in Bursa, Turkey.
After the summer, I joined IBM as a systems programmer, first in Palo Alto, California, then in Rome, Italy, then back in Mountain View, California.
After leaving IBM, I started my own business as a proprietary software developer and member of a Limited Liability Company in California and Washington.
I now live in Vancouver, British Columbia, and spend much of my time working on open-source software.
