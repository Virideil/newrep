## **♥**{:.heart} Sponsor Me

You'll soon be able to sponsor me through [GitHub Sponsors][sponsors].
GitHub is covering all payment processing fees through May 2020 so that one-hundred percent of your sponsorship goes to the developers you fund.
GitHub expects to review my application by the week of February 17, 2020.

With your support, I'll be able to spend more time on the following projects.

### *Volano™*{:.sc} Chat Server

* Lead the development of the [open-source *Volano*{:.sc}][volano] chat server.

* Switch the build automation from Apache Ant and GNU Make to [Gradle][gradle].

* Refactor the *Volano*{:.sc} chat server for the latest [Java Development Kit][openjdk] (JDK).

* Develop a new client for the [modern Web][websockets] to replace the existing Java applets.

### Electronic Ink

* Post articles about running [Ubuntu Base][ubuntu] on Kobo e-readers and writing cross-platform apps for e-paper.

* Write a programming book on electronic ink and publish it under a Creative Commons [BY-SA][bysa] license.

* Create beautiful [open-source themes][skin] in monochrome and grayscale for JavaFX on e-paper.

* Develop useful open-source apps for e-paper and publish them in the [Snap Store][snap].

* Port the [Java Swing][swing] framework to devices with e-paper displays.

* Investigate porting [Flutter][flutter] and [Qt for Python][qt] to devices with e-paper displays.

### Bug Fixes
