# **â™¥**{:.heart} Sponsor Me

Thank you for your support!
I depend entirely on your contributions to finance my work in open-source software.
There are three options to start a sponsorship or make a donation:

**[GitHub Sponsors][github]**
: covers all payment processing fees, so 100% of your sponsorship goes to the developer.

  * Monthly donations in U.S. dollars (USD)
  * Requires a GitHub account

**[Liberapay][liberapay]**
: is an open-source crowdfunding platform run by a non-profit organization.

  * Weekly donations in U.S. dollars (USD), Canadian dollars (CAD), or euros (EUR)
  * Requires a Liberapay account

**[PayPal][paypal]**
: allows for donations without a credit card.

  * Monthly or one-time donations in U.S. dollars (USD)
  * Requires a PayPal account only for recurring donations

## Projects

With your support, I can continue to work on the following projects:

**OpenJDK and OpenJFX**
: Publish each new release of OpenJDK and OpenJFX in the Snap Store.
Work with the upstream projects to create verified reproducible builds.

**VOLANO Chat Server**
: Update the server with the latest Java features and rewrite the clients for the modern Web.
Make it easy to install, configure, and monitor the server.

**Programming Electronic Ink**
: Document how to design, code, and test Java apps for e-paper with Ubuntu on the Kobo e-reader.
