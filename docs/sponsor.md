# **♥**{:.heart} Sponsor Me

You'll soon be able to sponsor me through [GitHub Sponsors][sponsors].
GitHub is covering all payment processing fees through May 2020 so that one-hundred percent of your sponsorship goes to the developers you fund.

## Projects

With your support, I will be able to spend more time designing, building, and maintaining open-source software.
Listed below are some of the [free software][free-sw] projects and [free cultural works][freeworks] I hope to complete.

### *Volano™*{:.sc} Chat Server

* Manage contributions to the open-source [*Volano*{:.sc} chat server][volano].

* Switch the build automation from Apache Ant and GNU Make to [Gradle][gradle].

* Refactor the *Volano*{:.sc} chat server for the latest [Java Development Kit][openjdk] (JDK).

* Develop a new client for the [modern Web][websockets] to replace the existing Java applets.

* Publish the *Volano*{:.sc} chat server for Linux as an app in the [Snap Store][snap].

* Create a Web administrator interface for managing the *Volano*{:.sc} chat server.

### Electronic Ink

* Post articles about running [Ubuntu][ubuntu] and writing cross-platform apps for e-paper.

* Write a book on programming electronic ink, published under a [CC BY-SA][ccbysa] license.

* Create [open-source themes][skin] in monochrome and grayscale for JavaFX on e-paper.
